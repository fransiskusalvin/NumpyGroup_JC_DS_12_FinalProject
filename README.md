# CREDIT CARD CUSTOMER CLUSTERING OPTIMIZED WITH MACHINE LEARNING

## BACKGROUND
Almost every American, it seems, gets a new credit card offer in the mail almost every week. Credit cards are highly profitable, but only if the customers stays around for a while. It **costs about 80 dollars** to **acquire a new credit card customer** who **returns about 120 dollars per year** in profit, but **only if she keeps the card**. If customers **drops the card after a few weeks, or doesnâ€™t use the card**, the issuer will **lose that 80 dollars, plus some more money spent trying to reactivate her**. It is a tough business.
